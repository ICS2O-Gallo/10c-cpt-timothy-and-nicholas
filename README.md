Plane Game - Nicholas and Tim

**Status:** Under development

## Info

A pun on *plain* game, Plane Game is a side-scrolling game based off of PyArcade. The objective of the game is to travel the longest distance by avoiding or destroying obstacles. Players are encouraged to beat their previous high scores, which are stored in a non-volatile format, meaning that players can return to their game without losing their hard-faught records.

## Installation Instructions

### Plane Game requires the following packages:

• **Random**: https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html

• **PyArcade**: https://pypi.org/project/arcade/ 

Simply download the whole repository and after extracting, put it under a single directory, and run it with your IDE of choice.
